# YouTube Stats Dashboard for multiple channels
This simple application will run a static HTML page which can request YouTube data about a configured set of channels. 

This repo also includes tutorial steps to provide people, even very basic beginners learning web development for the first time, with a specific goal and iterative steps to get there. 

## Why this dashboard?
I regularly track a set of channels and look to see how subscription rates are growing/slowing to see how what our channel is doing compares against relevant comparison points. This dashboard allows a user to track that data themselves without visiting YouTube channels directly.

## What are these tutorial steps?
I wanted to learn how to use the YouTube API, but also re-learn some basic web development and JavaScript that I haven't touched in a while. As I went along iteratively building out the dashboard, I attempted to capture logical steps which could help somebody trying to learn. This provides a solid use case with a clear end-goal that pushes you iteratively through a learning process by adding extra technology slowly.

A lot of tutorials are very much like the classic 'Owl' tutorial meme and miss a lot of the middle steps. Here, I'd like to show you the steps that get you to the rest of the Owl!

Step 2 reads "Draw the rest of the fucking owl" showing a completed pencil drawing of a horned owl on a branch](./images/drawing-the-owl-tutorial.jpg "Owl Drawing Tutorial")

## Who is this for?
The initial lessons are intended for people new to web development. These early stages use basic HTML and markup. 
Later lessons use more advanced technology for intermediate developers looking to see how to try different concepts out.
